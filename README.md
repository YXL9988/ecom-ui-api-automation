# Ecommerce UI + API Tests

End-to-end demo combining **Playwright (UI)** and **pytest/requests (API)** for an ecommerce site.
It runs locally and on GitHub Actions, publishes an HTML report to GitHub Pages, and attaches UI test videos as workflow artifacts.

---
## Tech Stack
- Python, pytest
- Playwright (UI automation)
- requests (API)
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages

---

## What’s Covered

**UI (Playwright)**
- Basic navigation & core locators
- Add all items to cart / delete from cart
- Network stubbing: “no orders” and “unauthorized” flows
- Session storage / token reuse to bypass login
- Filters & search (some checks are skipped on CI where external data can vary)
- Video recording of browser sessions

**API (requests + pytest)**
- Login (positive & negative)
- Get products
- Create order
- Get orders
- Delete order history
- Negative token scenarios (missing, invalid, empty, dash)

## Quick Start
```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install --with-deps
```
---
## Provide test credentials
- Option A — Local file
- Create playwright_ecom-ui-api/data/credentials.json:
{
  "user_credentials": [
    { "case": "valid-1", "userEmail": "test915@gmail.com",  "userPassword": "Test12345", "expected": 200 },
    { "case": "valid-2", "userEmail": "test9152@gmail.com", "userPassword": "Test12345", "expected": 200 }
  ]
}
- (Negative cases are in credentials_negative.json and are already in the repo.)
- Option B — CI secrets (see CI section below): the workflow will generate credentials.json from secrets.

## Run Tests

```bash
# Run all (default)
pytest
```

```bash
# Only UI
pytest -m ui
```

```bash
# Only API
pytest -m api
```

```bash
# Single file / single test
pytest playwright_ecom-ui-api/test_framework_web_api.py
```
```bash
# Parallel (requires pytest-xdist)
pytest -n 3
```

```bash
#Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force reports -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; mkdir reports\videos -Force > $null; pytest -n 3 -rA -vv --html=reports/index.html --self-contained-html 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath reports\pytest.log

```

```bash
#macOS/Linux
rm -rf reports; mkdir -p reports/videos; set -o pipefail; pytest -n 3 -rA -vv --html=reports/index.html --self-contained-html 2>&1 | tee reports/pytest.log

```
---

## HTML Report & Videos
- After a local run, open reports/index.html in your browser.
- Playwright recordings are stored in reports/videos/ (one video per test that opened a browser).
---

---
## Public report
- After a successful run, the latest HTML report is published via GitHub Pages.
- You can find the link in the Actions → tests → deploy job output, or visit:
```bash
https://yxl9988.github.io/ecom-ui-api-automation/?sort=result
```

---

## Pytest configuration
We keep a small `pytest.ini` at the repo root:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = -q
testpaths = playwright_ecom-ui-api
pythonpath = .
python_files = test_*.py
python_functions = test_*

markers =
    ui: UI tests with Playwright
    api: API tests using requests/Postman
    e2e: End-to-end cross-layer flows
```
